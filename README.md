CerebroMesh Labs is at the forefront of decentralized AI development, leveraging blockchain technology to create cutting-edge Text-to-Speech (TTS) models.

## Overview

CerebroMesh Labs is a groundbreaking project that harnesses the power of decentralized collaboration to advance the state-of-the-art in open-source Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. By leveraging the Bittensor blockchain and a unique incentive mechanism, we aim to create the most advanced and accessible TTS models available.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Collaboration**: Utilize a network of over one million users to contribute to AI advancement.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Leverage Bittensor blockchain for secure and transparent operations.
- **Advanced TTS Models**: Develop cutting-edge Text-to-Speech technology.
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time leaderboard showcasing miner contributions and rewards.
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive charts and graphs for performance analysis.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modern Next.js 14 application structure with App Router:
