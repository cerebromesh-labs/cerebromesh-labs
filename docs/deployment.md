## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. A GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account with your CerebroMesh Labs project repository
2. A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account
3. All environment variables ready for production use

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Project

Ensure your project is ready for deployment:

- Run `npm run build` locally to check for any build errors
- Commit and push all changes to your repository

### 2. Connect to Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click on "New Project"
3. Select your CerebroMesh Labs repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project

### 3. Configure Your Project

1. Choose your project name
2. Select the framework preset (Next.js)
3. Set the root directory if your project is not in the repository root
4. Set the build command if it's different from the default (`next build`)

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Add any necessary environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section
3. Add each variable needed for your production environment

### 5. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and Vercel will start building and deploying your project.

## Environment Variables

Ensure you've set up all necessary environment variables. Common variables might include:

- API keys
- Database connection strings
- Feature flags

Example of setting an environment variable in Vercel:

1. In your project dashboard, go to Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add a new variable, e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
3. Set its value for production

## Continuous Deployment

Vercel supports continuous deployment out of the box:

1. Every push to your main branch will trigger a new deployment
2. You can set up preview deployments for pull requests

To customize this behavior:

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to the "Git" section
3. Adjust the production and preview branch settings as needed

## Custom Domains

To set up a custom domain:

1. In your Vercel project, go to "Settings" > "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update your domain's DNS settings as instructed by Vercel
4. Vercel will automatically provision an SSL certificate

## Monitoring and Analytics

Vercel provides built-in analytics and monitoring:

1. In your project dashboard, navigate to the "Analytics" tab
2. Here you can view performance metrics, visitor data, and more

For more advanced monitoring, consider integrating services like:

- Sentry for error tracking
- Google Analytics for user behavior analysis

## Troubleshooting

Common deployment issues and solutions:

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check the build logs in Vercel
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in `package.json`
   - Verify that your code works in a production build locally

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check the "Runtime Logs" in your Vercel project dashboard
   - Ensure all environment variables are correctly set

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use Vercel Analytics to identify slow pages or API routes
   - Consider implementing more aggressive caching strategies

4. **Domain Configuration Problems**
   - Double-check your DNS settings
   - Ensure your domain is verified in Vercel

If you encounter persistent issues, consult the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs) or reach out to Vercel support.

## Conclusion

Deploying CerebroMesh Labs to Vercel provides a streamlined, efficient process for getting your Next.js application into production. By following this guide and leveraging Vercel's features, you can ensure a smooth deployment process and maintain a high-performance application.

Remember to regularly update your dependencies, monitor your application's performance, and iterate on your deployment strategy as your project grows and evolves.
